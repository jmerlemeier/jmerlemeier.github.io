## Growth Mindset 
The idea that humans are inherent learners whose skills are improved with dedication and diligence. Someone is not simply born with all the skills they need, they must aquire them over time. This mindset allows a person to be adaptable to challenges and to succeed no matter the obstacle. Conversely, a person with a fixed mindset abandons challenge quickly. They are easily discouraged by the successes of others.

## Markdown 
Today, I learned that markdown is a language used in Github. It is a quick, easy way to create and publish content. With a little [help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#paragraphs-and-line-breaks), I learned how to write and format the page you see here. I can add links, *style text*, create lists, and use emojis :octocat:, too!

Some Basic Markdown Examples:

|Style|Syntax before word|Syntax after word
|---|---|---|
|**BOLD**| ** | ** |
|*Italics*| * | * |
