# Julie's Journal for Code 102

#### Julie's Code Journal of Learning

## Intro 
I was born in [New Orleans, LA](https://www.neworleans.com/things-to-do/haunted/); grew up in [Duluth, MN](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Duluth,+MN/@46.7646466,-92.3910849,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52ae527e782e37ff:0x90fdbf76eb580c72!8m2!3d46.7866719!4d-92.1004852); and moved to [Seattle, WA](https://theoatmeal.com/blog/seattle_weather) in 2009 for music. I have a Bachelor of Science in Cellular and Molecular Biology from UW. My love of medicine led me to work in women's heath, where I have been working for the past 3 years. I have a concert grand harp and a monster/cat named Pip. This year, I am focusing on my little garden. I hope my carrots will grow - plants usually come to my flower beds to *die*. For fun, I bake cookies and fresh peach cheesecake for friends. In the next 5 years, I would like to start keeping a small hive of bees.
