# Julie's Journal for Code 102

## Intro 
I was born in [New Orleans, LA](https://www.neworleans.com/things-to-do/haunted/); grew up in [Duluth, MN](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Duluth,+MN/@46.7646466,-92.3910849,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52ae527e782e37ff:0x90fdbf76eb580c72!8m2!3d46.7866719!4d-92.1004852); and moved to [Seattle, WA](https://theoatmeal.com/blog/seattle_weather) in 2009 for music. I have a Bachelor of Science in Cellular and Molecular Biology from UW. My love of medicine led me to work in women's heath, where I have been working for the past 3 years. I have a concert grand harp and a monster/cat named Pip. This year, I am focusing on my little garden. I hope my carrots will grow - plants usually come to my flower beds to *die*. For fun, I bake cookies and fresh peach cheesecake for friends. In the next 5 years, I would like to start keeping a small hive of bees.

## Growth Mindset 
The idea that humans are inherent learners whose skills are improved with dedication and diligence. Someone is not simply born with all the skills they need, they must aquire them over time. This mindset allows a person to be adaptable to challenges and to succeed no matter the obstacle. Conversely, a person with a fixed mindset abandons challenge quickly. They are easily discouraged by the successes of others. 

#### Reminders to help stay in a growth mindset
- [x] Take 3 deep breaths
- [x] Everyone is frustrated when they learn something new
- [x] You will get through this

## Markdown 
Today, I learned that markdown is a language used in Github. It is a quick, easy way to create and publish content. With a little [help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#paragraphs-and-line-breaks), I learned how to write and format the page you see here. I can add links, *style text*, create lists, and use emojis :octocat:, too!

Some Basic Markdown Examples:

|Style|Syntax before word|Syntax after word
|---|---|---|
|**BOLD**| ** | ** |
|*Italics*| * | * |

## Notes on The Command Line, ryanstutorials.net

- Command Line: text based interface to the system, according to the website
  * *prompt* is presented from terminal.
  * *command* is what I type.
  * *arguments* 
  * *options* typically stary with a dash and are used to modify the behavior of the command.
  * *outputs* 
 - The Shell: Part of the OS that defines how to terminal will behave, executes commands. **BASH** is an example of a shell.
 - Shortcuts rock!
   * use *UP* and *DOWN* keys to use recently used commands.
   
## Basic Navigation
   
   Path: a means to get a particular file or directory on the system. 
   - Location: File or directory
   - Root Directory: the Top of the hierarchy
   - Absolute: specify a location in relation to the root directory. Yes slash (/)
   - Relative: specify a location to where we currectly are in the system. No slash
   
   |command|define|Why use?|
   |-----|-----|-----|
   |*pwd* |Print Working Directory|Use to remind youself of where you presently are 
   |*ls* |List |Lists current location (contents in a current directory), can use with arguments
   |*ls -l*|Long listing option|Use when want more info than just ls
   |*ls /ect*|List a specific item's contents|Argument asking to list contents of directory named 'ect' instead of current directory
   | *~*| Shortcut for Home directory |If home is /home/julie then ~ is /home/julie. Can find docs with the path ~/Documents.
   |*.*| ref current directory|./Documents
   |*..*| ref parent directory|Use to go up the hierarchy, can use several times.
   |*cd* |Change directories|Take you instantly back to home directory|
   |*cd with argument*|Move to a specific directory|
   |*Tab completion*| Shortcut to typing|As you type, hit tab for autocomplete
   
 
## More about Files

Rule 1: Everything is a file
Rule 2: Linux is CAsE SeNSItivE
Rule 3: If you have **spaces** in your file name, you must use **'quotes'** or **escape/ characters**. You can also try **tab completion**
Rule 4: Hidden files are a thing. To make a hidden file simply put a .(full stop) in front of the name. To make unhidden, remove it. ls will NOT show hidden files. To see hidden files in addition to the other contents in the directory, use command: ls -a

Common Extensions [ryanstutorials.net]
* file.exe - an executable file, or program.
* file.txt - a plain text file.
* file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.

|command|define|Why use?|
|-----|-----|-----|
|*file* path|File with argument included |Tells type of file
|\ |Backslash is an escape character| nullify the special meaning of the **next** character
