## Growth Mindset :seedling:
The idea that humans are inherent learners whose skills are improved with dedication and diligence. Someone is not simly born with all the skills they near, they must aquire them over time. With a fixed mindset, the learner quickly abandons challenge. The growth mindset, conversely, allows a person to be adaptable to challenges and to succeed no matter the obstacle.

### Reminders :sunny:
- [x] Take 3 deep breaths
- [x] Everyone is frustrated when they learn something new
- [x] You will get through this
