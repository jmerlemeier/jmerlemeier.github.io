# Julie's Journal for Code 102

## Intro :honeybee:
I was born in [New Orleans, LA](https://www.neworleans.com/things-to-do/haunted/); grew up in [Duluth, MN](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Duluth,+MN/@46.7646466,-92.3910849,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52ae527e782e37ff:0x90fdbf76eb580c72!8m2!3d46.7866719!4d-92.1004852); and moved to [Seattle, WA](https://theoatmeal.com/blog/seattle_weather) in 2009. I have a harp named harp and a monster/cat named Pip. I am focusing on my little garden this year. I hope my carrots will grow - plants usually come to my flower beds to *die*. For fun, I bake cookies and fresh peach cheesecake for friends. In the next 5 years, I would like to start keeping a small hive of bees.

Here is my [Github Profile Page](https://github.com/jmerlemeier), enjoy!

## Growth Mindset :seedling:
The idea that humans are inherent learners whose skills are improved with dedication and diligence. Someone is not simly born with all the skills they near, they must aquire them over time. With a fixed mindset, the learner quickly abandons challenge. The growth mindset, conversely, allows a person to be adaptable to challenges and to succeed no matter the obstacle.

### Reminders :sunny:
- [x] Take 3 deep breaths
- [x] Everyone is frustrated when they learn something new
- [x] You will get through this

## Markdown :memo:
Today, I learned that markdown is a language used in Github. It is a quick, easy way to create and publish content. With a little [help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#paragraphs-and-line-breaks), I learned how to write and format the page you see here. I can add links, *style text*, create lists, and use emojis :octocat:, too!
