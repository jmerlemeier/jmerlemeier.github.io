# Julie's Journal for Code 102

## Intro 
I was born in [New Orleans, LA](https://www.neworleans.com/things-to-do/haunted/); grew up in [Duluth, MN](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Duluth,+MN/@46.7646466,-92.3910849,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52ae527e782e37ff:0x90fdbf76eb580c72!8m2!3d46.7866719!4d-92.1004852); and moved to [Seattle, WA](https://theoatmeal.com/blog/seattle_weather) in 2009 for music. I have a Bachelor of Science in Cellular and Molecular Biology from UW. My love of medicine led me to work in women's heath, where I have been working for the past 3 years. I have a concert grand harp and a monster/cat named Pip. This year, I am focusing on my little garden. I hope my carrots will grow - plants usually come to my flower beds to *die*. For fun, I bake cookies and fresh peach cheesecake for friends. In the next 5 years, I would like to start keeping a small hive of bees.

## Growth Mindset 
The idea that humans are inherent learners whose skills are improved with dedication and diligence. Someone is not simply born with all the skills they need, they must aquire them over time. This mindset allows a person to be adaptable to challenges and to succeed no matter the obstacle. Conversely, a person with a fixed mindset abandons challenge quickly. They are easily discouraged by the successes of others. 

#### Reminders to help stay in a growth mindset
- [x] Take 3 deep breaths
- [x] Everyone is frustrated when they learn something new
- [x] You will get through this

## Markdown 
Today, I learned that markdown is a language used in Github. It is a quick, easy way to create and publish content. With a little [help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#paragraphs-and-line-breaks), I learned how to write and format the page you see here. I can add links, *style text*, create lists, and use emojis :octocat:, too!

Some Basic Markdown Examples:

|Style|Syntax before word|Syntax after word
|---|---|---|
|**BOLD**| ** | ** |
|*Italics*| * | * |
