### Ch. 4, Loops and Decisions
- Loops are used when you want to execute the me code block more than once. They check a condition
  * For (specific number of times)
  * While (code will run if condition is true)
  * Do While (code will run if condition is true. If false, it will always run statemet at least once)

- Loop Counters, use *for*
  for (var i = 0; i<10; i++>) {
    document.write(i);
  }
Variable 'i' is assigned. Condition is less than 10, the counter is 'i++'

---------------------------------------------------------------------

- Decisions occur where the code will take one of two paths. you set a **condition** to determine with path to take.
  * Two components to a decision: 
    - An expression is evaluated (often with T/F), which return a value
    - A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation (if/then/else)

- Comparason operators
  * *==*
  * *!=*
  * *===*strictly equal
  * *!==*
