## HTML&CSS by *Jon Duckett*

### Ch. 10, Introducing CSS

#### Thinking about it
Imagine there is an invisible box surrrounding each HTML element.
```
CSS Rule contains 2 parts: selector and declaration
          p {
            font-family: Arial;
          }
    The declaration has 2 parts: property and value
          color is a property and yellow is a value
``` 
* CSS rules usually appear in a different document

### Ch. 11, Color
####Selectors
* [color picking tool](colorschemedesigner.com)
* Use a combination of color names, hex codes, RGB, and HSL to achieve brilliant colors
  - {color: DarkCyan;}
  - {color: #ee3e80;}
  - {color: (rgb9200, 200, 200);}
  - {background color: hsla(0, 100%, 100%, 0.5);}
